# Authentic-Vs-Fake-Image-Classification
This project belongs to a series of projects on classsification in machine learning. Here using deep learning techniques, the aim is to determine which Convolutional Neural Network works best for the task of classifying fake and authentic images. This project analyzes the performance of two state of the art Convolutional Neural Network Models for this classfication task; The ResNet-18 and VGG-16 CNN Models. By establishing which of these two CNN models performs best, improving the accuracy of results in the digital forensics and medical imaging can be achieved.
